Student Name: 
- Jeryl Teo Jiele

Project Name: 
- Uncanny Village

What I implemented: 
- A simulation of birds vs humans, but with a twist.

Directions (if needed): 
- Just watch the simulation. 
- Birds will haunt a random Human, kill that Human and reproduce.
- Random ball that squashes everything in its path (Except Tree).
- Weird Tree messing with its birds.

What I liked about the project and framework:
- Crafting these uncanny interactions for the villagers was a highlight. It was cool to see how my ideas for quirky movements and unexpected actions worked out on the screen.

What I disliked about the project and framework:
- Repetition due the structures.
- Realising that certain things I implemented already existed (Unfamiliarity with engine)

Any difficulties I experienced while doing the project:
- The project felt a bit repetitive. It also became apparent that some features I was trying to implement were already built into the engine, due to my initial unfamiliarity with the engine.
